    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>An alfajore is a traditional cookie made most commonly in South America. There are many different versions and ways to make this cookie, but I believe this is the easiest way, with only 5 ingredients. It takes a while to make though.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h2>Steps</h2>


      <ol>
        <li>Place the entire, unopened can of condensed milk in a large saucepan. Fill the saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer and cook until milk inside has caramelized, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and set aside to cool while you make the cookies.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Mix in egg, then mix in flour until well combined.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by small teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Dip your finger into flour, and pat each cookie into a very thin, little circle (about the size of a quarter).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just starting to brown around the edges and no longer doughy in the centers, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Sandwich cooled cookies together with the caramelized condensed milk.</li>
      </ol>
